Description Changes under consideration for JDBC 4.2 include: Add a generic setter/update method to ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement to support new data types such as those being defined in JSR 310. Define REF_CURSOR support for CallableStatement. Specify required DataSource properties for a Java EE environment. Enhance DatabaseMetaData.getIndexInfo to provide new columns for CARDINALITY and PAGES which return a long value. Add a new DatabaseMeta method to return the logical maximum size for a LOB. Additional clean up of the spec as needed. Testing Changes will be mostly additions to existing interfaces. The JCK will need to tests added for any concrete methods/classes, e.g., PreparedStatement.setObject(int pos, Object val, SQLType type). Risks and Assumptions The primary risk of this change is that any change affecting method type-inference has the potential for backwards incompatibility. Dependences JSR 310, the new Date and Time API (JEP 150). Impact Compatibility: Minimal - Additional methods will be added to existing interfaces, but that only affects JDBC drivers. Existing JDBC applications will continue to run unmodified.
