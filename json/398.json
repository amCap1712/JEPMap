It is essentially irrelevant since all web-browser vendors have either removed support for Java browser plug-ins or announced plans to do so. History The Applet API was previously deprecated, though not for removal, by JEP 289 in Java 9. Description Deprecate, for removal, these classes and interfaces of the standard Java API: java.applet.Applet java.applet.AppletStub java.applet.AppletContext java.applet.AudioClip javax.swing.JApplet java.beans.AppletInitializer Deprecate, for removal, any API elements that reference the above classes and interfaces, including methods and fields in: java.beans.Beans javax.swing.RepaintManager javax.naming.Context Testing Hundreds of tests need to be either modified or removed before the Applet API is removed, but this JEP is solely about deprecation-for-removal. We will review these tests to determine if further @SuppressWarnings annotations are required. Risks and Assumptions In case remaining uses of these APIs do exist, developers can suppress compiler warnings via the @SuppressWarnings(\"removal\") annotation or the -Xlint:-removal command-line option of the javac compiler.","updated":"2021/08/09 14:56","status":"Closed\u2009/\u2009Delivered"}
