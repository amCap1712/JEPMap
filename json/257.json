Non-Goals It is not a goal to introduce any new functionality, e.g., dynamic pipelines. Motivation The version of GStreamer included in FX/Media today is out of date, and is missing stability and performance fixes made to GStreamer's C code since June of 2011. Updating from the current 0.10.35 version to a 1.x version of GStreamer requires time and effort, and we would like to be proactive in updating so that we can more easily respond to future GStreamer security updates. Description The latest stable release of GStreamer is 1.4.4, released on 2014/11/10. Integrating this release will require updating our existing plug-ins, since it contains incompatible API changes. The JFXMedia layer that builds the GStreamer pipline should not require many changesd; it is most likely already compatible with the latest GStreamer. We will also need to update the copy of GLib included in FX/Media. (This is used on Windows and OS X, which do not themselves provide GLib; on Linux we use the GLib provided by the distro.) Our copy of GLib is currently at version 2.28.8; the new GStreamer requires at least 2.32, but it's better to take the latest, so we will update to GLib 2.42.1 and, along with that, LibFFI 3.2.1. Testing No new tests are needed.","updated":"2018/03/07 00:13","status":"Closed\u2009/\u2009Delivered"}
