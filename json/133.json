Non-Goals Two related Unicode specifications are not covered by this JEP: UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing Description Java SE 7 supports the Unicode Standard 6.0.0, which was the latest version of that standard at that time. After that we supported Unicode 6.1.0 released in February 2012 in JDK 8 and are now planning to support Unicode 6.2.0 released on September 2012. Specifically, the following were the primary changes in Unicode 6.1.0: add 11 new blocks to java.lang.Character.UnicodeBlock, add 7 new scripts to java.lang.Character.UnicodeScript, and support over 700 new characters in j.l.Character, String, and other classes. And the main change in Unicode 6.2.0 is to support a new Turkish currency sign(U+20BA). Testing Need to verify that the latest Unicode data is correctly used by classes such as java.lang.Character, java.lang.String and java.text.BreakIterator. Risks and Assumptions If a version newer than 6.2.0 is released in the JDK 8 time frame then this JEP will most likely be updated to specify that version. Dependences This feature depends on the Unicode Standard of the Unicode Consortium.","updated":"2019/05/13 22:54","status":"Closed\u2009/\u2009Delivered"}
