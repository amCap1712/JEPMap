This compiler has seen little use since its introduction and the effort required to maintain it is significant. Retain the experimental Java-level JVM compiler interface (JVMCI) so that developers can continue to use externally-built versions of the compiler for JIT compilation. Motivation Ahead-of-time compilation (the jaotc tool) was incorporated into JDK 9 as an experimental feature via JEP 295. The jaotc tool uses the Graal compiler, which is itself written in Java, for AOT compilation. The Graal compiler was made available as an experimental JIT compiler in JDK 10 via JEP 317. We have seen little use of these experimental features since they were introduced, and the effort required to maintain and enhance them is significant. These features were not included in the JDK 16 builds published by Oracle, and no one complained. Description Remove three JDK modules: jdk.aot \u2014 the jaotc tool jdk.internal.vm.compiler \u2014 the Graal compiler jdk.internal.vm.compiler.management \u2014 Graal's MBean Preserve these two Graal-related source files so that the JVMCI module (jdk.internal.vm.ci, JEP 243) continues to build: src/jdk.internal.vm.compiler/share/classes/module-info.java src/jdk.internal.vm.compiler.management/share/classes/module-info.java Remove HotSpot code related to AOT compilation: src/hotspot/share/aot \u2014 dumps and loads AOT code Additional code guarded by #if INCLUDE_AOT Finally, remove tests as well as code in makefiles related to Graal and AOT compilation. Alternatives Developers who wish to use the Graal compiler for either AOT or JIT compilation can use GraalVM. Risks and Assumptions We assume that developers actively using these features have had sufficient notice of this removal.","updated":"2021/08/05 02:44","status":"Closed\u2009/\u2009Delivered"}
